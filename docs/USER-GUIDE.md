# Gaimplan Beta Tester Guide

Welcome to the Gaimplan beta! This guide will help you install and start using Gaimplan, your new local-first knowledge management app.

## üìã What You'll Need

- **macOS computer** (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 supported)
- **No additional software required** - everything is included!
- **Windows / Lunux** - supported but not tested yet. 

## üöÄ Quick Installation

### Step 1: Download
1. Follow [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. A new window will open showing the Gaimplan app icon


üéâ **You're ready to start using Gaimplan!**

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers (Building from Source)

If you're building Gaimplan from source instead of using the pre-built installer:

### Additional Setup Required

**Install MCP Server Dependencies:**
```bash
# From the gaimplan root directory
cd mcp-servers

# Install dependencies for each server
cd filesystem-server && npm install && cd ..
cd search-server && npm install && cd ..
cd git-server && npm install && cd ..
cd neo4j && npm install && cd ..
cd qdrant-server && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cd ..  # Return to project root
```

**Why this is needed:**
- MCP servers are Node.js applications that need their dependencies installed
- The qdrant-server is TypeScript and needs to be compiled
- Pre-built installers include these dependencies, but source builds don't

**Then continue with:**
```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

## üè† First Time Setup

- **üü¢ Graph Sync**: Sync is enabled and working
- **‚ö´ Graph Sync**: Sync is disabled (click to enable)
- **Pending count**: Shows number of notes waiting to sync
- **Error indicator**: Shows if there are sync failures

### Automatic Setup
Neo4j integration starts automatically when you open a vault:

1. **Docker containers start**: Neo4j and Qdrant containers launch in background
2. **Connection established**: Graph sync connects and enables automatically
3. **No manual setup needed**: Everything happens transparently

### Accessing Neo4j Browser
To explore your knowledge graph:

1. **Open browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:7474
2. **Login credentials**: 
   - Username: `neo4j`
   - Password: Check your `.env` file or `NEO4J_PASSWORD` environment variable 
3. **View your graph**: See all notes as nodes with semantic relationships

### Performance Features
- **Smart debouncing**: 2s/5s/10s delays based on file size
- **Batch processing**: Updates processed in batches of 10 or every 30 seconds
- **Queue management**: Automatic deduplication of updates
- **Minimal logging**: Clean terminal output showing only sync summaries

### Testing Graph Sync
To verify graph sync is working:

1. **Check status bar**: Look for üü¢ Graph Sync indicator
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Run test command**: `window.testGraphSync()`
4. **Check status**: `window.checkGraphStatus()`
5. **View in Neo4j**: See your notes as nodes in the graph
6. **Clear graph data**: `window.clearGraphData()` to reset everything

### Graph Data Management
If you need to start fresh with your graph data:

**Via Console (Recommended):**
```javascript
window.clearGraphData() // Clears both Neo4j and Qdrant data
```

**Via Neo4j Browser (Direct):**
1. Open http://localhost:7474
2. Run: `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`
3. Run: `DROP CONSTRAINT unique_node_id IF EXISTS`

üí° **Note**: Neo4j integration requires Docker Desktop. If Docker is not installed, Gaimplan works normally without graph sync.
